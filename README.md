# SLM Lab [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/kengz/SLM-Lab.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/kengz/SLM-Lab) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/20c6a124c468b4d3e967/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/kengz/SLM-Lab/maintainability) [![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/20c6a124c468b4d3e967/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/kengz/SLM-Lab/test_coverage)
_(Work In Progress)_ An experimental framework for Reinforcement Learning using Unity and PyTorch.

## Installation

1.  Clone the Lab repo:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab.git
    ```

2.  Install Lab dependencies (or inspect `bin/*` before running):
    ```shell
    cd SLM-Lab/
    bin/setup
    yarn install
    source activate lab
    ```

3.  Install the bleeding-edge Unity `ml-agents` dependency:
    ```shell
    source activate lab
    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/kengz/ml-agents.git
    cd ml-agents/python
    pip install -e .
    cd ../SLM-Lab/
    ```

4.  Setup the created config files:
    -   `config/default.json` for local development, used when `grunt` is ran without a production flag.
    -   `config/production.json` for production lab run when `grunt -prod` is ran with the production flag `-prod`.

## Usage

### High Level `yarn` commands

| Function | `command` |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| install SLM-Env Unity env and Lab dependencies | `yarn install` |
| start the Lab | `yarn start` |
| update dependency file | `yarn update-dep` |
| update environment | `yarn update-env` |
| run tests | `yarn test` |
| clear cache | `yarn clear` |

## Notebook

The Lab uses interactive programming and lit workflow:

1.  Install [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/)
2.  Install [Hydrogen for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen) and [these other Atom packages optionally](https://gist.github.com/kengz/70c20a0cb238ba1fbb29cdfe402c6470#file-packages-json-L3)
3.  Use this [killer keymap for Hydrogen and other Atom shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/kengz/70c20a0cb238ba1fbb29cdfe402c6470#file-keymap-cson-L15-L18).
    -   Install [Sync Settings](https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings)
    -   Fork the keymap gist
    -   Then update the sync settings config
4.  Open and run the example `slm_lab/notebook/intro_hydrogen.py` on Atom using Hydrogen and those keymaps
5.  See `slm_lab/notebook/intro_unity.py` to see example of Unity environment usage
6.  Start working from `slm_lab/notebook/`

## Experiment

_To be set up_

## Unity Environment

The prebuilt Unity environments are released and versioned on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/), under names `slm-env-{env_name}`, e.g. `slm-env-3dball`, `slm-env-gridworld`. To use, just install them via `yarn`: e.g. `yarn add slm-env-3dball`.

Check what env_name is available on the git branches of [SLM-Env](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Env.git).

For building and releasing Unity environments, refer to [README of SLM-Env](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Env.git).
