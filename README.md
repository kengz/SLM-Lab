An experimental framework for Reinforcement Learning using Unity and PyTorch.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab.git
  ```

2. Install dependencies (or inspect `bin/*` before running):
  ```shell
  bin/setup
  source activate lab
  ```

3. Setup config files:
  -  `config/default.json` for local development, used when `grunt` is ran without a production flag.
  -  `config/production.json` for production lab run when `grunt -prod` is ran with the production flag `-prod`.

## Usage

### Notebook

The Lab uses interactive programming and lit workflow:

1. Install [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/)
2. Install [Hydrogen for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen) and [these other Atom packages optionally](https://gist.github.com/kengz/70c20a0cb238ba1fbb29cdfe402c6470#file-packages-json-L3)
3. Use this [killer keymap for Hydrogen and other Atom shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/kengz/70c20a0cb238ba1fbb29cdfe402c6470#file-keymap-cson-L15-L18).
  - Install [Sync Settings](https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings)
  - Fork the keymap gist
  - Then update the sync settings config
4. Open and run the example `slm_lab/notebook/hydrogen.py` on Atom using Hydrogen and those keymaps
5. Start working from `slm_lab/notebook/`
