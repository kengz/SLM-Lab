## Implementations

SLM Lab implements most of the recent canonical algorithms and various extensions. These are used as the base of research. All the implementations follow this design:

- `Agent`: the base class containing all the components. It has the API methods to interface with the environment.
    - `Algorithm`: the main class containing the implementation details of a specific algorithm. It contains components that are reusable.
        - `Net`: the neural network for the algorithm. An algorithm can have multiple networks, e.g. Actor-Critic, DDQN.
    - `Body`: connects the agent-env, and stores the proper agent-env data, such as entropy/log_prob. Multitask agent will have multiple bodies, each handling a specific environment. Conversely, a multiagent environment will accept multiple bodies from different agents. Essentially, each body keeps track of an agent-env pair.
        - `Memory`: stores the numpy/plain type data produced from the agent-env interactions used for training.

- `BaseEnv`: the environment wrapper class. It has the API methods to interface with the agent. Currently, the Lab contains:
    - `OpenAIEnv` for [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
    - `UnityEnv` for [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

#### Algorithm

code: [slm_lab/agent/algorithm](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/tree/master/slm_lab/agent/algorithm)

Various algorithms are in fact extensions of some simpler ones, and they are implemented as such. This allows for concise and safer code.

**Policy Gradient:**
- REINFORCE
- AC (Vanilla Actor-Critic)
    - shared or separate actor critic networks
    - plain TD
    - entropy term control
- A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)
    - extension of AC with with advantage function
    - N-step returns as advantage
    - GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimate) as advantage
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
    - extension of A2C with PPO loss function
- SIL (Self-Imitation Learning)
    - extension of A2C with off-policy training on custom loss
- PPOSIL
    - SIL with PPO instead of A2C

Using the lab's unified API, **all the algorithms be ran in a distributed fashion**, with Session (DistSession in fact) taking the role of workers under a Trial. Some of the distributed algorithms have their own name:

- A3C (Asynchronous A2C / distributed A2C)
- DPPO (Distributed PPO)

**Value-based:**
- SARSA
- DQN (Deep Q Learning)
    - boltzmann or epsilon-greedy policy
- DRQN (Recurrent DQN)
- Dueling DQN
- DDQN (Double DQN)
- DDRQN
- Dueling DDQN
- Multitask DQN (multi-environment DQN)
- Hydra DQN (multi-environment DQN)

As mentioned above, **all these algorithms can be turned into distributed algorithms too**, although we do not have special names for them.

Below are the modular building blocks for the algorithms. They are designed to be general, and are reused extensively.

#### Memory

code: [slm_lab/agent/memory](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/tree/master/slm_lab/agent/memory)

`Memory` is a numpy/plain type storage of data which gets reused for more efficient computations (without having to call `tensor.detach()` repeatedly). For storing graph tensor with the gradient, use `agent.body`.

Note that some particular types of algorithm/network need particular types of Memory, e.g. `RecurrentNet` needs any of the `SeqReplay`. See the class definition for more.

For on-policy algorithms (policy gradient):
- OnPolicyReplay
- OnPolicySeqReplay
- OnPolicyBatchReplay
- OnPolicyBatchSeqReplay

For off-policy algorithms (value-based)
- Replay
- SeqReplay
- SILReplay (special Replay for SIL)
- SILSeqReplay (special SeqReplay for SIL)
- ConcatReplay
- AtariReplay
- PrioritizedReplay

#### Neural Network

code: [slm_lab/agent/net](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/tree/master/slm_lab/agent/net)

These networks are usable for all algorithms, and the lab takes care of the proper initialization with proper input/output sizing. One can swap out the network for any algorithm with just a spec change, e.g. make `DQN` into `DRQN` by substituting the net spec `"type": "MLPNet"` with `"type": "RecurrentNet"`.

- MLPNet (Multi Layer Perceptron, with multi-tails support)
- HydraMLPNet (multi-heads, multi-tails)
- RecurrentNet (with multi-tails support)
- ConvNet (with multi-tails support)

These networks are usable for Q-learning algorithms. For more details see [this paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/wangf16.pdf).

- DuelingMLPNet
- DuelingConvNet

#### Policy

code: [slm_lab/agent/algorithm/policy_util.py](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/blob/master/slm_lab/agent/algorithm/policy_util.py)

The policy module takes the network output `pdparam`, constructs a probability distribution, and samples for it to produce actions. To use a different distribution, just specify it in the algorithm spec `"action_pdtype"`.

- different probability distributions for sampling actions
- default policy
- Boltzmann policy
- Epsilon-greedy policy
- numerous rate decay methods

## Experimentation framework

Deep Reinforcement Learning is very empirical. The systematic building blocks above need a experimentation framework to study variables systematically. The experiment framework completes the lab.

## Installation

1. Clone the [SLM-Lab repo](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab):
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies (or inspect `bin/setup_*` first):
    ```shell
    cd SLM-Lab/
    bin/setup
    yarn install
    source activate lab
    ```

>Alternatively, run the content of `bin/setup_macOS` or `bin/setup_ubuntu` on your terminal manually.
>Docker image and Dockerfile with instructions are also available

### Setup

A config file `config/default.json` will be created at installation.

```json
{
  "data_sync_dir": "~/Dropbox/SLM-Lab/data"
}
```

- If you run the lab on a remote server and want to sync the `data/` folder for easy access, update `"data_sync_dir"`. When running a job, use a new terminal session to run `yarn watch` for auto-copy .

### Update

To update SLM Lab, pull the latest git commits and run update:

```shell
git pull
conda env update -f environment.yml; yarn install;
```

>Alternatively, use the shorthand command `yarn update` to replace the last line

### Demo

Run the demo to quickly see the lab in action (and to test your installation).

![](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/assets/demo.png)

It is `DQN` in `CartPole-v0`:

1. see `slm_lab/spec/demo.json` for example spec:
    ```json
    "dqn_cartpole": {
      "agent": [{
        "name": "DQN",
        "algorithm": {
          "name": "DQN",
          "action_pdtype": "Argmax",
          "action_policy": "epsilon_greedy",
        ...
        }
      }]
    }
    ```

2. see `config/experiments.json` to schedule experiments:
    ```json
    "demo.json": {
      "dqn_cartpole": "dev"
    }
    ```
    > To run faster, change lab mode from "dev" to "train" above and rendering will be disabled.

3. launch terminal in the repo directory, run the lab:
    ```shell
    source activate lab
    python run_lab.py
    ```
    >Alternatively, use the shorthand command `yarn start` to replace the last line
    >To access GUI from remove server, use `-X` flag during ssh like so `ssh -X foo@bar`. See [Debugging](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/installation/debugging.html) for more.

4. This demo will run a single trial using the default parameters, and render the environment. After completion, check the output for data `data/dqn_cartpole_2018_06_16_214527/` (timestamp will differ). You should see some healthy graphs.

    >Trial graph showing average envelope of repeated sessions.

    ![](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/assets/demo_session_graph.png)
    >Session graph showing total rewards, exploration variable and loss for the episodes.

5. Enjoy mode - when a session ends, a model file will automatically save. You can find the session `prepath` that ends in its trial and session numbers. The example above is trial 1 session 0, and you can see a pyotrch model saved at `data/dqn_cartpole_2018_06_16_214527/dqn_cartpole_t1_s0_model_net.pth`. Use the prepath at `config/experiments.json` to run eval mode:
    ```json
    "demo.json": {
      "dqn_cartpole": "eval@data/dqn_cartpole_2018_06_16_214527/dqn_cartpole_t1_s0"
    }
    ```
    >enjoy mode will automatically disable learning and exploration. Graphs will still save.

6. Next, change the run mode from `"train"` to `"search"`  `config/experiments.json`, and rerun. This runs experiments of multiple trials with hyperparameter search. Environments will not be rendered.:
    ```json
    "demo.json": {
      "dqn_cartpole": "search"
    }
    ```
    When it ends, refer to `{prepath}_experiment_graph.png` and `{prepath}_experiment_df.csv` to find the best trials.

>If the demo fails, consult [Debugging](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/debugging.html).

Now the lab is ready for usage.
