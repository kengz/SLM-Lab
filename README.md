## Features

### Algorithms

SLM Lab implements a number of canonical RL [algorithms](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/tree/master/slm_lab/agent/algorithm) with reusable **modular components** and *class-inheritance*, with commitment to code quality and performance.

The benchmark results also include complete [spec files](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/tree/master/slm_lab/spec/benchmark) to enable full **reproducibility** using SLM Lab.

Below shows the latest benchmark status. See [benchmark results here](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md).

### Environments

SLM Lab integrates with multiple environment offerings:
  - [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
  - [OpenAI Roboschool](https://github.com/openai/roboschool)
  - [VizDoom](https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom#documentation) (credit: joelouismarino)
  - [Unity environments](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) with prebuilt binaries

*Contributions are welcome to integrate more environments!*

### Metrics and Experimentation

To facilitate better RL development, SLM Lab also comes with prebuilt *metrics* and *experimentation framework*:
- every run generates metrics, graphs and data for analysis, as well as spec for reproducibility
- scalable hyperparameter search using [Ray tune](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tune.html)


## Installation

1. Clone the [SLM Lab repo](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab):
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies (this uses Conda for optimality):
    ```shell
    cd SLM-Lab/
    sudo bin/setup
    ```

  >To avoid running sudo on the whole setup, run `bin/setup` instead and install the relevant OS specific dependencies manually. The most likely additional dependency you will need to install is Xvfb. with `sudo apt-get install -y xvfb`

  >Alternatively, instead of `bin/setup`, copy-paste from [`bin/setup_macOS` or `bin/setup_ubuntu`](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/tree/master/bin) into your terminal to install manually.

## Quick Start

#### DQN CartPole

Everything in the lab is ran using a `spec file`, which contains all the information for the run to be reproducible. These are located in `slm_lab/spec/`.

Run a quick demo of DQN and CartPole:

```shell
conda activate lab
python run_lab.py slm_lab/spec/demo.json dqn_cartpole dev
```

This will launch a `Trial` in *development mode*, which enables verbose logging and environment rendering. An example screenshot is shown below.

![](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/assets/demo.png)

Next, run it in training mode. The `total_reward` should converge to 200 within a few minutes.

```shell
python run_lab.py slm_lab/spec/demo.json dqn_cartpole train
```

>Tip: All lab command should be ran from within a Conda environment. Run `conda activate lab` once at the beginning of a new terminal session.

This will run a new `Trial` in *training mode*. At the end of it, all the metrics and graphs will be output to the `data/` folder.


#### A2C Atari

Run A2C to solve Atari Pong:

```shell
conda activate lab
python run_lab.py slm_lab/spec/benchmark/a2c/a2c_gae_pong.json a2c_gae_pong train
```

![](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/assets/demo_atari.png)
>Atari Pong ran with `dev` mode to render the environment

This will run a `Trial` with multiple Sessions in *training mode*. In the beginning, the `total_reward` should be around -21. After about 1 million frames, it should begin to converge to around +21 (perfect score). At the end of it, all the metrics and graphs will be output to the `data/` folder.

Below shows a trial graph with multiple sessions:

![](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/assets/demo_atari_graph.png)

#### Benchmark

To run a full benchmark, simply pick a file and run it in train mode. For example, for A2C Atari benchmark, the spec file is `slm_lab/spec/benchmark/a2c/a2c_atari.json`. This file is parametrized to run on a set of environments. Run the benchmark:

```shell
python run_lab.py slm_lab/spec/benchmark/a2c/a2c_atari.json a2c_atari train
```

This will spawn multiple processes to run each environment in its separate `Trial`, and the data is saved to `data/` as usual.

#### Experimentation / Hyperparameter search

An [`Experiment`](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/blob/master/slm_lab/experiment/control.py) is a hyperparameter search, which samples multiple `spec`s from a search space. `Experiment` spawns a `Trial` for each `spec`, and each `Trial` runs multiple duplicated `Session`s for averaging its results.

Given a spec file in `slm_lab/spec/`, if it has a `search` field defining a search space, then it can be ran as an Experiment. For example,

```shell
python run_lab.py slm_lab/spec/demo.json dqn_cartpole search
```

Deep Reinforcement Learning is highly empirical. The lab enables rapid and massive experimentations, hence it needs a way to quickly analyze data from many trials. The experiment  and analytics framework is the scientific method of the lab.

## Design Principles

SLM Lab is created for deep reinforcement learning research and applications. The design was guided by four principles
- **modularity**
- **simplicity**
- **analytical clarity**
- **reproducibility**

#### Modularity

- makes research easier and more accessible: reuse well-tested components and only focus on the relevant work
- makes learning deep RL easier: the algorithms are complex; SLM Lab breaks them down into more manageable, digestible components
- components get reused maximally, which means less code, more tests, and fewer bugs

#### Simplicity

- the components are designed to closely correspond to the way papers or books discuss RL
- modular libraries are not necessarily simple. Simplicity balances modularity to prevent overly complex abstractions that are difficult to understand and use

#### Analytical clarity

- hyperparameter search results are automatically analyzed and presented hierarchically in increasingly granular detail
- it should take less than 1 minute to understand if an experiment yielded a successful result using the [experiment graph](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/analytics/experiment-graph.html)
- it should take less than 5 minutes to find and review the top 3 parameter settings using the [trial](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/analytics/trial-graph.html) and [session](https://kengz.gitbooks.io/slm-lab/content/analytics/session-graph.html) graphs

#### Reproducibility

- only the spec file and a git SHA are needed to fully reproduce an experiment
- all the results are recorded in [BENCHMARK.md](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md)
- experiment reproduction instructions are submitted to the Lab via [`result` Pull Requests](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+label%3Aresult+)
- the full experiment datas contributed are [public on Dropbox ](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y738zvzj3nxthn1/AAAg1e6TxXVf3krD81TD5V0Ra?dl=0)
