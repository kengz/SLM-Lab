class Replay(Memory):
    '''
    Simple storage for storing agent experiences and sampling from them for agent training

    An experience consists of
        - state: representation of a state
        - action: action taken.
                - One hot encoding (discrete)
                - Real numbers representing mean on action dist (continuous)
        - reward: scalar value
        - next state: representation of next state (should be same as state)
        - done: 0 / 1 representing if the current state is the last in an episode
        - priority (optional): scalar value, unnormalized

    The memory has a size of N. When capacity is reached, the oldest experience
    is deleted to make space for the lastest experience.
        - This is implemented as a circular buffer so that inserting experiences are O(1)
        - Each element of an experience is stored as a separate array of size N * element dim

    When a batch of experiences is requested, K experiences are sampled according to a random uniform distribution.

    All experiences have a priority of 1.
    This allows for other implementations to sample based on the experience priorities
